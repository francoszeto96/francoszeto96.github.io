            <h3>I am...</h3>
            <p>

              <br>
            An undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor studying Biomolecular Science and Computer Science. <br><br>

            I came into college interested in healthcare, with the goal of attending pharmacy school after my undergraduate studies. I discovered a passion for technology during my sophomore year, leading to a pursue of degrees in both fields. I hope to apply my skillsets in a fulfilling career, making a positive impact on the community. <br><br>

            When I am not studying medicine or coding, I enjoy lifting weights, doing yoga, discovering new restaurants, going on walks, binge watching TV shows, and keeping up with recent health/technology advances.

            <h3>Fun (and random) Facts!</h3>
            <p>
              1.) Born in Hong Kong and moved to Macomb, MI in 2004.<br><br>
              2.) Almost became British by immigrating to the U.K. instead, where most of my extend family are. <br><br>
              3.) Pineapples go on pizzas. That's a fact. <br><br>
              4.) I went skydiving 2 days before high school graduation. One of the best experiences of my life and would highly recommend it. <br><br>
              5.) Squat: 320 Bench: 285 Deadlift: 405 <br><br>
              6.) Went to the movies during one of those unlimited popcorn refills nights. Finished my movie, then went to different rooms to watch two more. Let's just say I ate a LOT of popcorn that night. <br><br>
              7.) I had over 7k calories once for one meal. It was unintentional, but very tasty. I think MDining actually loses money from me. <br><br>
              8.) Favorite dessert: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tart">Egg Tarts</a>. <br><br>
              9.) When I was an intern, I was referred to as "the gravy on top" during a team meeting to estimate work output. <br><br>
